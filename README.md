# Objective:
Built a smalljavaScript App about 'Pokemon' called 'Pokedex'. The app should display a list of pokemon and some information about the pokemon when the user click on it. 

**First step** is to create the Pokemon items with the help of an IIFE function Variable, Arrays and objects.

**second step** is to display the items on the app by using a forEach function and conditions with if.. else statments. 

**API** fetched a list of pokemon from 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/' 

**Bootstrap-Modal** The pokemon information(Name, height and image) should display on the Modal. Once the user 'close', outside the modal or escape key clicked, the modal should be closed.

**Bootstrap-nav** is created to search for any Pokemon displayed in the list.
